## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A vibrant orange (#FF8C00) representing energy, enthusiasm, and team spirit, as typically seen in basketball environments.
- Background color: A light gray (#F0F0F0) provides a neutral backdrop that emphasizes the content and avoids distracting from the court schedule.
- Accent color: A deep blue (#1E90FF), for interactive elements and key data points. This adds contrast and aids in quick recognition.
- Font Pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines, and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text, gives a modern and readable aesthetic.
- Use clean and modern icons representing basketball actions and positions. Icons should be consistent and easily understandable.
- Clear and intuitive layout, with a focus on drag-and-drop functionality for easy time planning.
- Smooth transitions when dragging and dropping players and subtle highlighting of players scheduled to play. These are small animations and visual cues that provide feedback to user interactions.
